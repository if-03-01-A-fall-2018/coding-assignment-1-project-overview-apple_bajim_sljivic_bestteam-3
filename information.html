                <h2>1976 – 1983</h2>
                <p>The birthplace of Apple Computer. In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded the company in the garage of his childhood home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California. Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer single-handedly designed and hand-built by Wozniak and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club. The Apple I computer sold for $666.66. The Apple II arrives one year later. The duo's second attempt at creating a personal computer was far more successful. The device is credited with helping to spark a revolution in personal computers for the home. Apple starts selling the “Lisa,” a desktop computer for businesses with a graphical user interface, the system most users are familiar with today.</p>

The commercial is now hailed as a watershed event for Apple's success and was called a "masterpiece" by CNN and one of the greatest commercials of all time by TV Guide.

                <p>2008 - Apple opens its App Store as an update to iTunes.

Researcher iSuppli estimates 12.9 million iPads were shipped as of December 10. <br>November 2010 - The Beatles’ 13 albums become available on iTunes, ending years of talks between Jobs, Beatles’ management company Apple Corps and Beatles label EMI Group. <br>January 17, 2011 - Jobs announces that he will take another medical leave. <br>February 10, 2011 - Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, starts selling the iPhone in stores and puts an end to ATandT’s exclusive contract for the phone in the United States. <br>February 15, 2011 - Apple launches a long-awaited subscription service for magazines, newspapers, videos and music — a move that could hurt streaming services Netflix and Hulu. <br>March 2, 2011 - Apple launches the iPad 2, a sleeker, lighter version of its tablet with a new dual-core processor, two cameras and, for the first time, it comes in either white or black. <br>On October 5, 2011, Steve Jobs died, marking the end of an era for Apple. The first major product announcement by Apple following Jobs's passing occurred on January 19, 2012, when Apple's Phil Schiller introduced iBooks Textbooks for iOS and iBook Author for Mac OS X in New York City. Jobs had stated in his biography that he wanted to reinvent the textbook industry and education. <br>Apple's battle in the courtroom against Samsung began in 2011, when the company accused the electronics maker of copying the look and features of the iPhone with its line of Galaxy smartphones. The battle has gone all the way to the Supreme Court, which said this month it will review an appeal by Samsung on the ruling that awarded Apple $548 million in damages. <br>From 2011 to 2012, Apple released the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5,  which featured improved cameras, an intelligent software assistant named Siri, and cloud-sourced data with iCloud; the third and fourth generation iPads, which featured Retina displays and the iPad Mini, which featured a 7.9-inch screen in contrast to the iPad's 9.7-inch screen. These launches were successful, with the iPhone 5 (released September 21, 2012) becoming Apple's biggest iPhone launch with over two million pre-orders and sales of three million iPads in three days following the launch of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad (released November 3, 2012).  Apple also released a third-generation 13-inch MacBook Pro with a Retina display and new iMac and Mac Mini computers.  <br>Apple takes a huge plunge into digital music by acquiring Beats Electronics, makers of the trendy Beats headphones, for more than $3 billion in May 2014. Apple would leverage Beats' expertise toward its own streaming music service, called Apple Music. <br>At the end of its fall 2014 event, when it introduced the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, rock band U2 performed. After the performance, U2 and Tim Cook announced the band's new album would be free to everyone. However, not many people were thrilled with a free U2 album invading their libraries, prompting Apple to instruct users how to hide it. <br>Apple joins companies including Samsung, Pebble and Fitbit in the wearables market with the Apple Watch. Although the Watch hasn't become a massive hit like earlier products, analysts project the device to eventually catch on with consumers. <br>A federal judge on Feb. 16, 2016, rules Apple must comply with an FBI order to unlock an iPhone used by one of the killers in the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings. Apple refuses, saying the solution Apple would create is equivalent to building a "back door" on the iPhone. The FBI withdrew its case on March 28 after breaking into the phone without Apple's help.</p>

            <h1>Marketing</h1>
            <section>
                Apple is the largest brand in the technology industry in terms of its revenue generated as well as its brand ranking. It is not a surprise to many because Apple has time and time again presented products which were ground breaking and which revolutionised the market. <br>There are three major segments which Apple targets. It generally uses lifestyle segmentation as Apple is the most premium brand out there. The segment is usually the urban population with enough buying power for purchasing Apple products. These are people who are early adopters in life but the brand equity of Apple is such that even laggards have started adopting the products. <br>In the Marketing strategy of Apple, it has three target groups <br>One is the music lovers who are targeted by the Apple Ipod and Itunes. <br>Another target the professionals or even teenagers who are targeted for Apple Iphone, Tablets, Macbook and other such gadgets which can be used by anyone, irrespective of age. <br>And third is the crowd which can use their other products and services like Apple TV and Apple Iwatch. They also use Ibooks, Apple pay etc. <br>Apple being the world’s number 1 brand has the topmost mind positioning and there is no doubt that when someone talks about Smartphones or Laptop or Tablets, Apple is the first brand that comes to mind maximum number of times. <br>We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products and that’s not changing. We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the simple not the complex. We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make, and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution. <br>We believe in saying no to thousands of projects, so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot. And frankly, we don’t settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the self- honesty to admit when we’re wrong and the courage to change. And I think regardless of who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well. <br>Tagline – “Think Different” is one of the best slogans in the tech industry. Many people assume that Apple launched the slogan “Think different” in response to IBM’s slogan “Think”. However, since 2002, Apple stopped using the slogan in its marketing. But from time to time, the slogan has bounced back on Apple’s website or in their marketing and it has never left the mind of Apple loyal consumers.
